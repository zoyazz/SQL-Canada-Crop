# SQL-Canada-Crop
Using R's libraries, I ran SQL queries on Canadian crops using data from statistics Canada. The report contains descriptive statistics about crops including most successful year of yield, average crop yield and which crop is most profitable and prices of crop in both USD and CAD. 

Included concepts:
-Aggregation

-Union

-Subqueries

-Case When, SUM(CASE WHEN...)

-DateDiff

-Creating new columns

-JOIN Types

-Row numbers/ranking based on value

-Max/Min/Average
